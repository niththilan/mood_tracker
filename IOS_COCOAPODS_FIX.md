# iOS CocoaPods Dependency Resolution Fix

## Issue
- Error during pod install caused by version conflicts between Firebase and Google Sign-In dependencies
- Conflicting GoogleUtilities versions: Firebase wants ~> 7.12, Google Sign-In wants ~> 8.0

## Root Cause
- Firebase Core 2.32.0 requires Firebase SDK 10.25.0 which depends on GoogleUtilities ~> 7.12
- Google Sign-In 6.x requires GoogleSignIn ~> 8.0 which depends on GoogleUtilities ~> 8.0
- These version ranges don't overlap, causing a dependency conflict

## Solution Applied

### 1. Temporary Fix (Working)
- Removed google_sign_in dependency temporarily to resolve conflicts
- Updated pubspec.yaml to comment out Google Sign-In
- iOS app now builds and runs successfully with Firebase auth only

### 2. Version Compatibility Matrix
Compatible combinations:
- Firebase Core 2.24.0 + Google Sign-In 5.4.4 (uses older GoogleUtilities)
- Firebase Core 2.32.0 without Google Sign-In (current working state)

### 3. Permanent Solution Options

#### Option A: Use older Firebase versions
```yaml
firebase_core: ^2.24.0
firebase_auth: ^4.15.0
google_sign_in: ^5.4.4
```

#### Option B: Use newer Firebase with dependency overrides
```ruby
# In Podfile
pod 'GoogleUtilities', '~> 8.0'
```

#### Option C: Use alternative auth provider
- Keep Firebase for email/password auth
- Use Supabase for Google auth (via Supabase Auth)

## Current Status
✅ CocoaPods install working
✅ iOS build successful
✅ App launches on iPhone 16 Plus simulator
⚠️ Google Sign-In temporarily disabled

## Next Steps
1. Test current app functionality without Google Sign-In
2. Choose permanent solution approach
3. Re-implement Google Sign-In with compatible versions

## Files Modified
- `/ios/Podfile` - Cleaned up dependency overrides
- `/pubspec.yaml` - Temporarily commented out google_sign_in
