# Android Build.gradle.kts Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the VS Code IDE error in `android/build.gradle.kts` that was showing:
```
Could not create task ':gradle:test'.
Could not create task of type 'Test'.
Type T not present
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by the modern Gradle directory API (`layout.buildDirectory`) conflicting with the VS Code Gradle extension's type inference system. While the build worked functionally, the IDE couldn't properly analyze the Kotlin DSL.

## Solution Applied
Reverted to the deprecated but compatible `buildDir` property instead of `layout.buildDirectory`. This resolves the IDE error while maintaining full build functionality.

## Changes Made

### Before (causing IDE errors):
```kotlin
layout.buildDirectory.set(file("../build"))
subprojects {
    layout.buildDirectory.set(file("${rootProject.layout.buildDirectory.get()}/${project.name}"))
}
tasks.register<Delete>("clean") {
    delete(rootProject.layout.buildDirectory)
}
```

### After (working solution):
```kotlin
rootProject.buildDir = file("../build")
subprojects {
    project.buildDir = file("${rootProject.buildDir}/${project.name}")
}
tasks.register("clean", Delete::class) {
    delete(rootProject.buildDir)
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ VS Code IDE error resolved 
- ✅ `./gradlew clean` works successfully
- ✅ `flutter build apk --release` builds successfully
- ✅ All Google Services integration maintained
- ⚠️ Build shows deprecation warnings for `buildDir` (expected, will be addressed in future Gradle versions)

## Notes
- The deprecation warnings are cosmetic and don't affect functionality
- This solution maintains compatibility with current Flutter/Gradle toolchain
- Future updates can migrate back to `layout.buildDirectory` when VS Code Gradle extension improves support
